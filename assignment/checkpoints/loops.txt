# 1 - In your opinion, what are the benefits of using loops?
saving time of looping vs. having to rewrite something again and again and again

# 2 - What kind of loop would you want to use if you wanted to do something a certain number of times: for or while?
for loops

# 3 - What kind of loop would you want to use if you wanted to do something as long as a condition were true: for or while?
while loops

# 4 - What is wrong with the argument for this for loop: `for(i = 0; i < array.length; i++)`?
it should be i<hand.length to see all of the cards in the array. Declare the i variable using let 

# 5 - What does it mean if you get a console error like this: "Uncaught ReferenceError: i is undefined"?
i only exists within the for loop code block
